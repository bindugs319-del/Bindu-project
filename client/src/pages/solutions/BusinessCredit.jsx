  { q: "Q1. What exactly is the CreditDataWatch Business Credit Bureau?", a: "CreditDataWatch is a platform specifically designed to offer end-to-end credit intelligence and oversight for the B2B sector. Our system allows vendors and purchasers to digitize their deals, secure formal acknowledgments, and flag non-paying entities. By centralizing this data, we foster a culture of honesty and reliability in commercial trade." },
  { q: "Q2. What is the process for reporting a non-paying business?", a: "To list a defaulter, simply create an account on the CreditDataWatch portal using your valid GSTIN. After logging in, you can submit the details of the defaulting party, including the specific transaction records and their history of missed payments. Once authenticated, the entity is added to our national database, serving as a warning to the community and helping you recover your funds." },
  { q: "Q3. How does the Automated Payment Alerts system work?", a: "This tool removes the stress of manual collections by scheduling automatic nudges for your clients. The platform dispatches reminders via email, ensuring your invoices stay top-of-mind. The system is designed to track engagement and can increase the frequency or tone of the alerts if a payment remains outstanding, significantly boosting your chances of getting paid on time." },
  { q: "Q4. In what ways can CreditDataWatch help my company grow?", a: "Integrating CreditDataWatch into your daily operations offers several strategic advantages: risk assessment (review financial track records before signing contracts), accountability (officially log and monitor non-payment cases), efficiency (automate your entire collection workflow), financial health (keep cash flow steady and predictable), and market standing (build a reputation as a credit-disciplined business)." }
