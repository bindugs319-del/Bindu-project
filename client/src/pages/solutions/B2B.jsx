  { q: "Q1. What solutions does CreditDataWatch provide for B2B companies?", a: "Our B2B suite includes a variety of tools designed to safeguard your trade credit. These include comprehensive business credit profiles, automated payment alerts, financial tracking, defaulter registries, and debt resolution services. We also provide risk benchmarking to help you compare your credit health against industry standards. Together, these services make managing business relationships much more efficient." },
  { q: "Q2. How do automated payment alerts improve B2B operations?", a: "Automated alerts take the manual work out of chasing payments. The system sends scheduled notifications via email to remind your clients about upcoming or overdue bills. By staying on top of these deadlines automatically, you can reduce late payments and ensure your business maintains a healthy, steady cash flow." },
  { q: "Q3. Is it possible to report a business for non-payment?", a: "Yes. If a business entity or MSME fails to honor its payment commitments, registered members can issue legal notices and request assistance through CreditDataWatch's Legal Support feature. The defaulting MSME will be listed on CreditDataWatch's Global Rating Dashboard, ensuring visibility across the network. This shared intelligence helps other businesses identify and avoid high-risk partners. Public listing also motivates debtors to settle dues promptly, fostering accountability and encouraging fair business practices." },
  { q: "Q4. Why should I check a Business Credit Report before a partnership?", a: "A Business Credit Report acts as a financial background check. It details a company's past payment habits, current debt levels, and overall financial reliability. By reviewing this report before signing a contract, you can accurately judge the risk of working with a new buyer or supplier, helping you build partnerships based on facts rather than guesswork." },
  { q: "Q5. How does the payment settlement process work?", a: "The process is a vertical timeline:\nStep 1 — Reporting: The unpaid debt is logged on the platform.\nStep 2 — Notification: We initiate communication with the buyer to inform them of the report.\nStep 3 — Resolution: Both parties can use our tools to track and negotiate terms.\nStep 4 — Completion: Once the payment is received, the creditor marks the case as \"Settled.\"\nStep 5 — Status Update: The listing is updated or removed based on the agreement, helping the buyer restore their credit standing." }
