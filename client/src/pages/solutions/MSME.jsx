              Driving National Growth: The Power of Indian MSMEs
            </h3>
            <p style={{ fontSize: '15px', lineHeight: 1.7, color: '#333' }} className="leading-relaxed">
              Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) have become the backbone of India's economic engine. With a massive network of over 80 million registered units, this sector is a powerhouse for creating jobs, fostering local innovation, and boosting global exports. Currently, MSMEs generate approximately 29% of the nation's GDP, acting as a primary catalyst for widespread financial development.

            <p style={{ fontSize: '15px', lineHeight: 1.7, color: '#333' }} className="leading-relaxed">
              To foster this vital sector, the Indian government has launched several supportive frameworks. These include digitized registration systems, easier access to capital, and technological grants. Small businesses today benefit from lower-interest loans, tax breaks, and priority status in government tenders. Together, these initiatives create a supportive environment where small enterprises can scale and contribute to the country's wealth.
