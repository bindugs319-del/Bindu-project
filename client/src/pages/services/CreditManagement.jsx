              Credit details will be entered manually or via automatic bulk PO uploads. Credit Data Watch members are given the option to upload supporting attachments. These uploads are approved by the Credit Data Watch support team to appear in the global star ratings. This visibility immediately impacts the defaulter's credit score, warning other businesses and decreasing their overall market credibility.
